### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andy Boothe, and I'm a Software Engineer. And Architect. Oh, and Data Scientist, too. Just an all-around nerd.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on open source projects, my own ideas over at [aleph0](https://github.com/aleph0), and freelancing. I have deep professional experience in designing and building cloud-based software and data platforms, by myself and by leading teams. If you think I can help, drop me a line!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Java-based open source projects that will have a big impact.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Open an issue on [sigpwned/sigpwned](https://github.com/sigpwned/sigpwned), or use the email in my GitHub address!
